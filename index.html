<h3> About Heaven</h3>

 <p> Heaven is the highest, most blessed realm where you dwell in the presence of God. You'll be with the angels and the righteous. When entering heaven, you will have <em>eternal joy and everlasting peace.</em> In <strong>heaven</strong>, there will be rejoicing, praising, ane worshiping. Weather it be with your voice, your instrument, your art, your dance, or just yourself. When entering heaven, you are promised a manchine. Isn't that inticing!? I can assure you that this is the best place not just to visit, but to <strong> <em> live!!!</em></strong></p>

 <h3> How to get to heaven</h3>

 <p> Many make the mistake in thinking that in order to make it to heaven, you have to <em>die.</em> While that may be true, there's more to it. In order to make it into heaven, you have to <strong>live.</strong> You must live righteous. Lead with love and not hate. Repent for your mistakes. Read your bible to gain wisdom and understand his word. God wants a relationhip with you, but he can only do so much. You have to meet him halfway. Most importanly, you must acknowlodge God as the head of your life and understand that he has full control. We are on this earth to serve him. That's all you have to do.🤷🏽‍♀️ Pretty simple really. Good luck on your journey to <strong> <emp>heaven.</emp></strong> </p>
